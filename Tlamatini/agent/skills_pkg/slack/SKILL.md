# Slack skill

Use the Slack Web API. `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` must be in env.

## Endpoints

- `post`         → `chat.postMessage`
- `reply`        → `chat.postMessage` with `thread_ts`
- `read-history` → `conversations.history`
- `react`        → `reactions.add`
- `upload`       → `files.upload` (or `files.uploadV2` for >5MB)

Endpoints are at `https://slack.com/api/<method>`. Token goes in
`Authorization: Bearer ...`. Body is `application/json` for most modern
methods.
